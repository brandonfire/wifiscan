* **Size** display current logfile size

Generate GPX
============

We provides a perl script to generate gpx from the log file:

```
cat ssidLogger.log | ./log2gpx.pl > ourput.gpx
```

`log2gpx.pl` will store lat/lon cache at the file `/tmp/bssidCache` to speed up the API look up time on duplicate bssid. If you want to clear up the cache, just delete this file.
